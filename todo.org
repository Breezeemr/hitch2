* selectors

** http

** another one

** lifecycle methods

have less than half. need to look in machines

** make implementation of react manager

** value deriver

might be able to drop that off

dget stuff

but need basic dget support

** decision points for meeting

*** how do we want to do selectors

want some benchmarks inside the graph. see if when using the graph do selectors even matter. before we were measuring just selectors but need to see it wholisticly.

*** atom transient graph manager

*** agent graph manager

*** need graph benchmarker

** logger

add logger like francis did. good way to introduce to inside of the graph.

"fast enough in the browser". server doesn't matter.

** serialization

what is the plan to serialize selectors (big decision point)

1. what is representation
2. how do we serialize precisely. vector, map, down in the details. transit at the bottom no matter what.

** mandatory decisions

1. serialization
2. selector implementation
